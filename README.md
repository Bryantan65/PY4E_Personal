As I'm going for a computer science degree in 2 years, I've started picking up coding again (which I've tried and dropped many times already haha)

The main things I struggle with learning coding are
- Giving up too early (Mostly due to frustration)
- No plan to study, finished codeacademy and from there, had no idea where to go?
- Procrastination (huge bruh moment but yes)

But enough is enough, I will start earnestly learning and begin with the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) program, and hopefully in 2 years, I will come back to this and look back on my progress
